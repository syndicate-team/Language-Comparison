## Crossplatform

Crossplatform means the language is able to answer yes to these two questions:

"Is it a good experience to write medium-sized programs that will work on all
platforms the compiler supports?"

"Can you easily compile TO any platform FROM any platform?"

## Full type erasure

Full type erasure means the types are completely gone at runtime by default
(optional explicit decoration per-declaration is okay).
